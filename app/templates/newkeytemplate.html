<h3>Hello,</h3>
<p>
    You are receiving this email because a wallet has been created for you on BitGo.
    BitGo uses a trust-less 2 of 3 wallet model where only you have control of the funds secured on the blockchain.
    You hold the user key and co-sign with BitGo for transactions.
    <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">{{:servicename}} will hold your final backup key for you in cold storage to be used under the following circumstances:</span>
</p>
<ul>
    <li>You misplace your recovery keycard and forget your BitGo password. </li>
    <li>BitGo becomes inaccessible.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please visit us at <a href="{{:serviceurl}}">{{:serviceurl}}</a> for more information. </p>
<h3><strong>The Backup Key Generated</strong></h3>
<p>
    <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">The backup public key generated for you is:</span>
    <span style="line-height: 1.5em; text-decoration: underline"><strong><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 205);">{{:pub}}</span></strong>.</span>
    <br/>
</p>
<h3><strong>Enhanced Security</strong></h3>
<p><span style="line-height: 1.5em;">We recommend you take the following steps to enhance the security of your wallet:</span></p>
<ol>
    <li>Verify the value of your public key above with that on the backup section of your BitGo keycard. This validates that the key was not changed in transit. </li>
    <li>Upgrade your backup verification requirements by contacting us at <a href="mailto:{{:adminemail}}">{{:adminemail}}</a> and sending us more documentation to associate your identity with. We will require this documentation in the case of a recovery event. </li>
</ol>
<br/>
<p>
    <span style="line-height: 1.5em;">Regards,<br/></span>
